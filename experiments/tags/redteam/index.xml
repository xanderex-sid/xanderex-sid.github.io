      <description>&lt;p&gt;The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT. We (including my team at OpenAI, shoutout to them) have invested a lot of effort to build default safe behavior into the model during the alignment process (e.g. via &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/research/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback&#34;&gt;RLHF&lt;/a&gt;). However, adversarial attacks or jailbreak prompts could potentially trigger the model to output something undesired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large body of ground work on adversarial attacks is on images, and differently it operates in the continuous, high-dimensional space. Attacks for discrete data like text have been considered to be a lot more challenging, due to lack of direct gradient signals. My past post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-01-02-controllable-text-generation/&#34;&gt;Controllable Text Generation&lt;/a&gt; is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
