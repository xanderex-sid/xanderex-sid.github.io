# My Thoughts About Current World and My Life

<p>I have been very frustrated by myself and I have been experiencing dilemma in my actual interests. What I like, what I want to do in my life, what drives me, I have been reflecting myself in a very wrong way.</p>
<p>I'm being influenced by too much information from social media such as youtube, x.com, instagram and also from my friend. It creates an unnecessary FOMO (fear of missing out) which I think everyone needs to deal with.</p>
<p>Even I have used ChatGPT and Claude for life questions. And I must tell you never use them to get answers of your life, most of the time they will only say what you want to listen unconsciously.</p>
<p>Those who want to really get into AI that is learning model architecture, how AI exactly works, it will take too much effort, you have to learn lot of things, read lot of books, read and understand lot of research papers and have to do ton of experiments to get proper grasp in it.</p>
<p>And current AI requires lot of compute (GPU, TPU) so forget about doing something amazing in AI, solo, alone in your room. You can buy and rent cloud GPU but it is expensive for someone living in a country like india. You can't build a single thing without real compute in AI.</p>
<p>That's why, best thing to do to learn and get hands-on experience in real AI is to join R&D team of an organization but many organizations are asking for masters and PhD degrees for such roles.</p>
<p>So, other way of using AI or just using it for your products - If you want to pursue career with shallow knowledge of AI (meaning playing with APIs), just doing web development properly, learning how to make systems using APIs for AI, API for chatbots, API for model inference, API for vectorDB, how to use databases, learning all this stuff is enough.</p>
<p>If you want to play just with APIs and like doing web and app development, you can make solo products, go sell them, you will earn money and you can call yourself `entrepreneur`, `solopreneur`, all those fancy words.</p>
<p>But forget calling yourself real AI engineer or a real business man.</p>
<p>Because your API startups, your API products will fail, mark my words, it will fail, unless you put something real into it, your own algorithm, your own AI model or your own system.</p>
<p>Products using only APIs, can never sustain for long time, because there is no novelty in your product and anyone can easily replicate your API products.</p>
<p>But if you want something `REAL` - building a real startup, solving a real problem, it takes specialists to work, peoples who have dedicated at least few years building something that can be called as `real skill`.</p>
<p>Just saying that "I am hardworking and I can figure out anything by searching on google and asking ChatGPT, Claude" is not enough. Many people are hardworking and many people have this `meta-skill`.</p>
<p>`meta-skill` are the skills that all smart peoples have, it is not enough or I can say, it is zero. You can consider it equal to having zero skills.</p>
<p>If you want to build something like Meta, Google, X, Tesla, Nvidia, Oracle, SoftBank, etc - It takes efforts, team of specialists and a leader that can be called as `T-person`.</p>
<p>Who is `T-person`, peoples who have in-depth knowledge in one field but simultaneously have skills in other fields, qualities of management, communication and leadership.</p>
<p>These `T` peoples can only become successful and can lead an long-term (like forever) organizations.</p>
<p>And if you want to become such a `T` person, your first priority must be, must be to get in-depth knowledge in one field. Only path is to become first a specialist then build something and eventually these experiences will make you that `T-person`.</p>
<p>I can give you ton of examples - Jeff Bezos from Amazon, Bill Gates from Microsoft, Steve Jobs from Apple, Elon Musk from (Tesla, SpaceX), Mark Zuckerberg from Meta, Jensen Huang from Nvidia, Masayoshi Son from SoftBank, Jack Ma from Alibaba, Jamie Dimon from JP Morgan, etc. </p>
