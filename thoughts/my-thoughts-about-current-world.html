    <h1>My Thoughts About Current World</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>First of all, sorry for my english, I'm practicing my communication skills both in writing & speaking and I will get better in it for sure.</p>
        
        <p>So here I go...</p>
        
        <p>I have been very frustrated by myself and I have been experiencing dilemma in my actual interests. What I like, what I want to do in my life, what drives me, I have been reflecting myself in a very wrong way.</p>
        
        <p>I'm being influenced by too much information from social media such as youtube, x.com, instagram and also from my friends. It creates an unnecessary FOMO (fear of missing out) which I think everyone needs to deal with.</p>
        
        <p>Even I have used ChatGPT and Claude for life question-answers. And I must tell you never use them to get answers of your questions about your life decisions, most of the time they will only say what you want to listen unconsciously.</p>
        
        <p>Never take guidance from your friends for your personal interests (who have different interests from you). It will always be better to either ask those who have same interest as you and those who are professionals in the field.</p>
        
        <p>I am not saying your friend's guidance is wrong. What I am saying is most of the time, your friends who have different interests, unconciously might be trying to influence you to join them in their goal. And you will get influenced unconciously if you trust their guidance a lot. So whenever in doubt ask only professionals or people with same interests or people who can see a different point of view than yours. Asking friends for guidance is not always a right decision.</p>

        <p>So if you ask me, what type of problems I like to solve, after thinking too long, seeing patterns of what I love watching on youtube and instagram, what type of movies I like to watch, it's world of finance. I don't know if it's money that attracts me or the system of it that attracts me or I see it as a sport, a game with high risk, high returns with instant results and instant impacts. Maybe all of it... ;)</p>
        
        <p>I love everything about finance - finance theory, mathematics related to finance, quantitative finance, how economic factors affect financial markets, trading, history related to finance, all of it. I can spend all my time just learning these things.</p>
        
        <p>Problem is, there is too much bullshit going on in social media, that it is the best time to build startups, earn instant money, AI, AI, AI everywhere, you can easily build AI startups alone, you don't need a team anymore, blah, blah, blah. World is moving towards AI, today this new AI model come, this new thing released in AI. AI, AI, AI, just fuck!!!</p>
        
        <p>In reality if you are an introvert like me and you don't have amazing friends with different skillsets, you can't build anything in AI (end-to-end product) on your own.</p>
        
        <p>Those who want to really get into AI that is learning model architecture, how AI mathematically exactly works, it will take too much effort, atleast 2 years, you have to learn lot of things, read lot of books, read lot of research papers and have to do ton of experiments to get proper grasp in this field and then you can make something amazing out of it.</p>
        
        <p>And current AI requires lot of compute (GPU, TPU) so forget about doing something big in AI, solo, alone in your room, you just can't do it. You can buy and rent cloud GPU for your toy projects, for kaggle competitions and for hackathons but it is expensive for someone living in a country like India. Mostly people stick to free resources like Kaggle GPUs, Google Colab, Lightning AI free GPUs, but You can't build a single real useful thing without required compute in AI and without a team. Your options is to get admitted in a university as a master or PhD student or do a research internship or just get into R&D team of an organization.</p>
        
        <p>That's why, best thing to do to learn and get hands-on experience in real AI is to join R&D team of an organization but many organizations are asking for masters and PhD degrees for such roles. Even getting an internship now days is very hard in this field.</p>
        
        <p>The influence of social media has made this field very crowded and sometimes I feel very lucky being in R&D team, working with AI models in my company.</p>
        
        <p>So, other way of using AI or just using it for your products - If you want to pursue career with shallow knowledge of AI (meaning playing with APIs), just doing web & app development, learning how to make systems using APIs of AI models, API for chatbots, API for model inference, API for vectorDB, how to use databases, learning all this stuff is enough.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to play just with APIs and you like doing web and app development, you can make solo products, go sell them, you will earn money and you can call yourself `entrepreneur`, `solopreneur`, all those fancy words.</p>
        
        <p>But forget calling yourself real AI engineer or a real business man.</p>
        
        <p>Because your API startups, your API products will fail, mark my words, it will fail, unless you put something real into it, your own algorithm, your own AI model or your own novel system.</p>
        
        <p>Products using only APIs, can never sustain for long time, because there is no novelty in your product and anyone can easily replicate your API products.</p>
        
        <p>But if you want something `REAL` - building a real startup, solving a real problem, it takes specialists to work, peoples who have dedicated at least few years building something called as - `real skill`.</p>
        
        <p>Just saying that "I am hardworking and I can figure out anything by searching on google and asking ChatGPT, Claude" is not enough. Many people are hardworking and many people have this `meta-skill`. And if you are totally new to a field, say making a website or an app, ChatGPT and Claude will not be able to help you to build full end-to-end product. They can only help you in tasks you already know about.</p>
        
        <p>`meta-skill` are the skills that all smart peoples have, it is not enough or I can say, it is zero. You can consider it equal to having zero skills.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to build something like Meta, Google, X, Tesla, Nvidia, Oracle, SoftBank, etc - It takes efforts, team of specialists and a leader that can be called as `T-person`.</p>
        
        <p>Who is `T-person`, peoples who have in-depth knowledge in one field but simultaneously have skills in other fields, qualities of management, communication and leadership. And these extra skills comes from experience, you can be confident but real deal comes only from experience.</p>
        
        <p>These `T` peoples can only become successful and can lead an long-term (like forever) organizations.</p>
        
        <p>And if you want to become such a `T` person, your first priority must be, must be to get in-depth knowledge in one field. Only path is to become first a specialist then build something and eventually these experiences will make you that `T-person`.</p>
        
        <p>I can give you ton of examples - Jeff Bezos from Amazon, Bill Gates from Microsoft, Steve Jobs from Apple, Elon Musk from (Tesla, SpaceX), Mark Zuckerberg from Meta, Jensen Huang from Nvidia, Masayoshi Son from SoftBank, Jack Ma from Alibaba, Jamie Dimon from JP Morgan, etc.</p>
        
        <p>So if you want to make a end-to-end product or build a startup - (1) either you've to get specialized in multiple things like AI, Web & App development, Sales, Communication skills (and it is very very hard to be specialized in multiple fields) if you want to do it all alone or (2) you've to build a team of specialists with different skill sets, a team you can use and guide to your goal and get your success.</p>
        
        <p>And simply if you just want to specialize in one field - forget everything and only and only, focus on learning and practice. learn. practice. learn. practice. just learn and practice. And learn from professional, legit resources.</p>

        <h2>I have learned few things from my experiences and you can call it facts or rules or just beliefs.</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Make your brain your tool, your labour and not your master.</li>
            
            <li>Do everything for yourself first and then for others. And I am not talking about just learning or building something. It includes - writing blogs, making youtube videos, posts on social media, writing research papers, documenting something or writing code, building a product, cleaning, even cooking. Everything you do, you must first satisfy yourself, you must first do it for yourself, don't do something by thinking that you will get something from others for doing it. Always, Do it for yourself first. If it's not important to you, don't do it. If you are doing something and it is never going to help you in any way in the future, don't do it. You are killing your inner-self, wasting time and missing an unknown opportunity by doing something that you're not doing for yourself.</li>
            
            <li>Never trust anything on social media easily and never get influenced on social media. Most of it is glorified and is a lie, only for views, likes and to increase subscribers and followers. Even if you think you are not getting influenced, mark my words, your decisions and choices in the future are being influenced by those instagram, tiktok reels, youtube videos and X posts. Don't do question-answering sessions with AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, etc about your personal topics. Use them only for your work and nothing else. They only say what you want to listen unconsciously.</li>
            
            <li>Being honest, trustworthy and humble is most and most important thing. The second most and most important thing is being - selfish and greedy. If you have all of these 5 qualities, you will always succeed in life. We humans (homo-sapiens) have become rulers of Earth and have come so far in tech or in anything is only because of our ego, our selfishness and because of our greed.</li>
            
            <li>30% Rule: If you think you like multiple fields (subjects/ topics), and want to find which field you like the most, take one field, and find most general resource of that field and start learning 30% portion of that resource/ book/ youtube video from the start. For example, take "Understanding Deep Learning" book if you think you're interested in the AI models you see everywhere on social media then start learning first 30% topics of this book, If you're able to stick with it without getting bored. Congrats! you found your interest. Otherwise, if you get bored before completing 30%, maybe this field is not for you. Look for something else.</li>
            
            <li>Learning is always hard, it takes efforts to learn something. It doesn't mean that learning can't be enjoyable. Because doing hard things for yourself is always enjoyable. But just watching a youtube video is not enough, learn from any resource, but practice it, take copy and pen, note down what you learned. Think about your learnings, think about theorems, problems you seen in the youtube video or a book or a blog post, think about it, try to understand it and feel it.</li>
            
            <li>While making notes or practicing code from a resource, never copy paste the resource. If you are copy pasting, you are simply wasting your time. You will not learn anything. Write code or write notes after reading or watching that portion in the resource and then think of the code, think of your insights and then code it or write down your insights. Notes are always to note down your insights and learnings and are not for copy pasting. Always collect and organize all of your resources related to a topic at one place.</li>
            
            <li>A person who always thinks will get into analysis-paralysis. You always must be taking actions more than thinking all day. remember this, actions > thinking. If you catch yourself thinking too much, make yourself busy by doing something productive. Don't start scrolling instagram, tiktok or watching youtube videos for fun. Either start doing something productive or start learning or reading something important. You have to keep yourself busy, thinking leads you to no where. Only actions produce results.</li>
        </ol>
